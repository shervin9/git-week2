<h3 style="color: rgb(255, 132, 0);">What is Cherry-Picking in Git?<h3>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">Cherry-picking is a Git command that allows you to select and apply a specific commit from one branch to another branch.
 This is useful when you want to incorporate a particular change or changes from one branch without merging the entire branch.<P>


<h3 style="color: rgb(203, 213, 10);">why we should use it?<h3>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">Cherry-picking is a valuable tool in Git, and it can be beneficial in several scenarios.Here are some key reasons why one might choose to use cherry-picking:

<li style="color: aliceblue;">Merging Branches</li>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">You may want to incorporate specific changes from one branch to another without merging the entire branch. This is particularly useful when:
You're working on a long-term feature branch that includes multiple changes, but you only want to take one specific
 commit related to a bug fix or enhancement.</p>
<li style="color: aliceblue;">Resolving Conflicts</li>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">You may encounter conflicts when merging branches, and you want to resolve them manually. Cherry-picking allows you to apply a specific 
commit from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.</p>
<li style="color: aliceblue;">Applying Hotfixes</li>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">You may need to quickly apply a hotfix to a production branch while you are also developing new features. Cherry-picking allows you to apply a
 specific commit from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.</p>
<li style="color: aliceblue;">Preserving Commit History</li>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">When you cherry-pick a commit, the original commit is preserved, but it creates a new commit in the target branch. This means that you maintain
 an accurate history of where changes came from, which is beneficial for tracking the evolution of your project.</p>
