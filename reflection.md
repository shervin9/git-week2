In this assignment, I faced several challenges when pushing my changes to the repository. One of the main problems was merge conflicts due to changes made by other colleagues that I hadn't received before I attempted to push. This resulted in an error message that prevented me from pushing my changes. To solve this problem, I ran a `git pull`, which allowed me to get the latest changes and manually resolve conflicts in the `index.html` file. A structured process like pull requests, which we'll learn about next week, can significantly increase collaboration by allowing team members to review each other's changes before merging them into the master branch. This not only helps identify potential conflicts early but also fosters better communication and quality control within the team. Also using branches in Git allows you to better manage projects, facilitate teamwork, and reduce the risks associated with changes
